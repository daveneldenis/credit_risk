# Credit Risk
Brief summary and analysis of the modelsâ€™ performance. Describe the precision and recall scores, as well as the balanced accuracy score. Additionally, include a final recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

## Resampling
### Naive Random Oversampling -
precision high risk = 0.01
recall high risk = 0.72
balanced accuracy score = 0.615
F1 high risk score  = 0.02

### SMOTE Oversampling -
precision high risk = 0.01
recall high risk = 0.60
balanced accuracy score = 0.624
F1 high risk score  = 0.02

### Undersampling -
precision high risk = 0.01
recall high risk = 0.55
balanced accuracy score = 0.488
F1 high risk score  = 0.01

### Combination Sampling -
precision high risk = 0.01
recall high risk = 0.72
balanced accuracy score = 0.642
F1 high risk score  = 0.02



## Ensemble
### Balanced Random Forest Classifier
precision high risk = 0.04
recall high risk = 0.64
balanced accuracy score = 0.776
F1 high risk score  = 0.07

### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
precision high risk = 0.07
recall high risk = 0.90
balanced accuracy score = 0.92
F1 high risk score  = 0.14
